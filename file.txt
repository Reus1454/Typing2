All the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust.
Chop your own wood and it will warm you twice.
Work hard to get what you like, otherwise you'll be forced to just like what you get.
In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.
Life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about.
The first thing you learn in life is you're a fool. The last thing you learn in life is you're the same fool.
